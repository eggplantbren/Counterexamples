Criticizing P-values is a favorite pastime among Bayesians. No
``counterexamples'' repository would be complete without it.

\section{Voilating {\em more}}
I learned this example from Alex Etz ({\tt http://alexanderetz.com/}).
Imagine a drug company has an old drug which is known to cure
75\% of patients of a disease. They are developing a new drug
which they hope will be even more effective.
The effectiveness of the old drug is $\theta_{\rm old} = 0.75$ and the
effectiveness of the new drug is $\theta_{\rm new}$, which is unknown.
Consider three ``coarse-grained''
hypotheses about the value of $\theta_{\rm new}$:

\begin{eqnarray}
H_<: \theta_{\rm new} < 0.75\\
H_0: \theta_{\rm new} = 0.75\\
H_>: \theta_{\rm new} > 0.75
\end{eqnarray}

To measure $\theta_{\rm new}$, the company tests the drug on $N=100$ patients
and counts the number, $x$, who recover.
